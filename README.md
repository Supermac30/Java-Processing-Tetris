# Processing Tetris
This is a version of tetris written in processing with controller compatability and runs on android.
This is my 11U Computer Science CPT. I am still working on it despite the fact that I already submitted it.

The game is almost fully complete except for the online feature. 
I would put an executable on here but the files processing creates is too big for GitHub.
An android version of the game can be found in the android folder.

To play download this directory and compile and run the file 'tetris.pde'.

The music used is not owned by me and can be found in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDCOcqpWTkY&t
## Controller Compatibality
To connect a controller connect the computer to the controller before opening the game. Make sure to enable it in settings. If the controller feels weird change the sensitivity. 

The game is preconfigured with a Playstation classic controller but any controller can be used. A screen will pop up when connecting a new controller, configure the controls in this screen.
